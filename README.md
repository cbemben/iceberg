## Overview

Details of this Kaggle challenge can be found
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), the challenge is to accurately
predict whether a passenger survived the shipwreck or not. The response
variable is binary and since a passenger cannot partially survive the
response variable will be either 1 or 0. This document will use the
[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) programming language and logistic
regression to attack the challenge.
