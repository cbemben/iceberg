## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
train <- read.csv(file = '~/projectrepos/titanic/data/train.csv')

str(train)
```

## Passanger Analysis

### Age

```{r}
hist(train$Age)
```

There are some null age values...

```{r}
table(is.na(train$Age))
prop.table(table(is.na(train$Age)))
```

almost 20% of the observations are missing an age value. __Circle back to this after further analysis, possible to impute based on another variable.__

```{r}
train$AgeGroup <- cut(train$Age, breaks = c(0,17,35,65,80), labels = c('<17','18-35','36-65','>=66'))

library(ggplot2)
ap <- ggplot(train, aes(x=Age, fill=Sex)) + geom_density(position = 'stack')

ap
```


```{r}
ap + facet_wrap('Embarked')
prop.table(table(train$Sex,train$Embarked))
```
