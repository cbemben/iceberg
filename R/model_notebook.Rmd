```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

```{r cars}
library(rstan)

simple_model <- stan_model('stan/mod001.stan')
print(simple_model)
```

Now generate some sample data

```{r pressure}
simple_fit <- sampling(
  simple_model,
  data = list(N=nrow(train), y=train$Age),
  chains = 1,
  iter = 1,
  algorithm = 'Fixed_param',
  seed = 123
)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
